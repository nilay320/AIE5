That's essentially the plot of the movie. John Wick (Reeves) is out to seek revenge on the people who took something he loved from him. It's a beautifully simple premise for an action movie - when action movies get convoluted, they get bad i.e. A Good Day to Die Hard. John Wick gives the viewers what they want: Awesome action, stylish stunts, kinetic chaos, and a relatable hero to tie it all together. John Wick succeeds in its simplicity.\")"

        "For the John Wick movie reviews dataset, the Contextual Compression (Rerank) method offers the best balance of performance, cost, and latency. While the Ensemble Retriever achieved the highest overall metrics, its excessive cost and latency make it impractical for most applications. The Contextual Compression approach delivers the highest precision (0.87) with good recall (0.83), making it particularly effective for movie reviews where opinion nuances matter. It strikes an optimal balance by first retrieving candidates efficiently, then applying targeted reranking to improve relevance, resulting in moderate latency without the timeout issues plaguing more complex methods. For budget-conscious implementations, the Naive RAG Chain provides a compelling alternative with strong performance at lower cost, while applications requiring minimal latency might consider BM25 despite its performance trade-offs."
